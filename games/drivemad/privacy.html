We know privacy and security is important to our users and this Privacy Policy will help you understand what information we collect, why we need it, and what we do with it. By using Drive Mad you agree to this policy.<h3>Analytics</h3><p>In order to improve Drive Mad we may collect usage statistics, such as the number of users, how often they play, and whether anyone actually buys anything. Drive Mad uses Google Analytics for Firebase to collect this analytics data and you can <a href=https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites>find more information here</a>.<h3>Personalized Ads</h3><p>You may choose to play Drive Mad for free, with ads. Your device has an Advertising Identifier and the ad provider uses this identifier, and information they have collected about you, to select content that is more likely to actually be of interest to you. Ads are entirely optional and you can opt out by simply using the in-app purchases instead. Drive Mad uses Google AdMob to provide ads and you can <a href=https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads>find more information here</a>.<h3>Crash Logs</h3><p>We do our best to find and fix software bugs before publishing new versions of the app. But, realistically, some bugs will slip through and may cause the Drive Mad app to crash. If this happens the app may send a crash log to help us find and fix the bug! Drive Mad uses Google Crashlytics to collect crash logs and you can <a href=https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy>find more information here</a>.<h3>Children's Privacy</h3><p>You must be 13 years of age or older to use Drive Mad. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Moreover, if you are younger than 18, then your parent or legal guardian must read and accept this Privacy Policy on your behalf.<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3><p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time and will notify you of any changes by publishing the new policy on this page. Any changes are effective immediately on publishing and you are advised to review this page periodically.</div><div class=footer><a href=privacy.html target=_blank>Privacy Policy</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=https://fancade.com/ target=_blank>Fancade</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=https://www.oddbotout.com/ target=_blank>Odd Bot Out</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href=https://www.mekorama.com/ target=_blank>Mekorama</a></div></div>
